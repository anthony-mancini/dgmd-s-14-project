# Real-time Data Charts

This folder contains code that generates a real-time chart with a data feed from the web socket server. Essentially it opens up a web-socket client to a web socket server hosted in the AWS cloud that pushes data to all other clients that it recieves from the sensor tile glove.


# Running the charts

To run these charts clone the repository and run this command to download all the packages from NPM:

```
npm i
```

Once they have downloaded, run the following command in your terminal to start the chart:

```
node index.js
```

Below is a screenshot of the chart:
