# DGMD S-14 Harvard Summer 2020 Final Project

## Description

This is a project using wearables technologies within VR contexts. For this project we hooked up the STM Sensor Tile to a VR scene running entirely within the web browser. We connected the Sensor Tile to the VR scene via a WebSocket client and server, hosted within the Amazon AWS cloud. Using the code in this repo, you can hook up your Sensor Tile to the cloud and move a virtual cube object within your browser.

We built this project to see the affects of opertating on similar objects in the physical world versus virtual worlds using a similar interface (in this case using your hand). As VR and AR technologies become more prevalent, it is important to understand the differences in interactions between the two. Additionally, as bandwidth has increased and online activity usage has grown, we believe it is important to study virtual reality within the contexts of the network, as there will be issues in the future of having to deal with interacting with virtual reality objects in the presence of latency.
